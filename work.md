From time to time I work on web based projects with clients who need custom software built for them. I would love to work on an interesting project with you if you have some good problem. I primary used Ruby on Rails for most software projects but I have also developed few Android applications.
<br>
It is very important to have three things in a project that I work on before starting. 
<br>

<h3> Base requirements </h3>
<ul>
<li> What is to be developed </li>
<li> When is it to be developed - with the deadline in place </li>
<li> End result for both the parties - and deadline for the the end result for both the parties. This would include deadline for the payment to be made in case work is delivered. </li>
</ul>

<br>

Using the above three points as the basis, here is something that I can provide and can not provide- <br>

<h3> Can provide </h3> <br>
<ul>
<li> Time estimation of project once requirements are handled. Note that this is called scoping in software and may need me a couple of days to scope a project. This is a normal course in software engineering. This is because most of the code written in software development is new - if it was already there, we would just use it and hence no need of managing the project or estimating anything. </li>
<li> Delivery of project on time, based solely on the initial specs agreed to and initial scoping done. If some features change mid-way, we might need to rescope the work.</li>
<li> Tested software at the time of delivery </li>
</ul>

<h3> Can not provide </h3> <br>
<ul>
<li> Unless I have agreed to long term software support, I can not provide support for software developed by me. I am usually engaged in new work most of the time. If you want long term support, please mention if beforehand and have a talk with me about it and costs associated with it. Companies provide support for the software they develop only if they charge a support fee. This is because time must be invested again in supporting the software and time is VALUABLE. </li>
<li> Respond to random, untimed requests based on features - unless that time is mutually agreed in advance.</li>
</ul>
