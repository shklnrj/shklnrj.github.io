Hello there! Welcome to my new website on programming :) I would write posts here
where I would mostly conver what I have been doing programming-wise and maybe other
technical things. Although I have another blog where I write personal musings, I have
been thinking in the past as well that technical posts do not suit well for a personal
blog as it is read by a lot of people who have no interest in programming.

And hence I am happy to discover Github hosted pages. This together with Jekyll means
that I can have my own website and blog posts without any issues on the internet.

I look forward to writing more posts here.
