Hello world!
I am Neeraj Shukla. One more resident of the planet earth in the Milky Way galaxy. I write software for earning my living as well as for fun sometimes. Otherwise, why on earth would I have this website? :) <br>
I love to write code in Ruby on Rails because the framework is fast and you can see what you are building really easily. The result is not hidden in some command line world, you just open the browser and see what the end user would see, in just an instant! Not only this, the Ruby language is nice to write code in. The language is a bit artistic to say the least and hence simple yet powerful.
<br>

Other than Rails, I have also dabbled into Android development - though I would say that I don't like the current dev tools for Android and there is scope for a lot of improvement, I like the end result - a beautiful and useful application.

My life is not limited to programming though, I do other things as well like traveling, hiking, writing poetry and in general, catching up with my friends.

Here is some more random trivia about me : <br>
